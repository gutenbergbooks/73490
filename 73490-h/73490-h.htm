</div>

<p>It had been an exceptionally cold
winter, and Mr. and Mrs.
<span class="cor" title="Source: Bushy-Tail" id="cor11">Bushy Tail</span> had found it very difficult
to keep themselves and their
two small children warm.</p>

<p>They had finally moved into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">(12)</span>
Grandmother Chipmunk’s <span class="cor" title="Source: house-tree" id="cor12">house tree</span>,
which seemed to be more
protected from the high winds
and the heavy snow-storms, than
their own pretty little nest. The
rooms were rather small, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">(13)</span>
and Grandmother Chipmunk snored
most awfully, so that for several
nights Baby <span class="cor" title="Source: Bushy-Tail" id="cor13">Bushy Tail</span> could not
sleep.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_012">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_012.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_012_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>One cold snowy day, Mrs. Bushy
Tail came into the living-room with
a very sober face.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_013">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_013.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_013_small.png" alt="Grandma Chipmunk"></a>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">(14)</span></p>

<p>“My dear,” she said to her husband,
“the acorns and pine-cones
are nearly gone, and with the exception
of a few dried apples and
lettuce leaves, there is nothing left
in the cupboard.”</p>

<p>“Ttt, Ttt,” said Grandma Chipmunk,
laying down her knitting,
and looking over her spectacles.
“Whatever shall we do? Starve?”</p>

<p>Thereupon little Frisky, the
oldest boy, set up a fearsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">(15)</span>
squeaking, for he liked good things
to eat, and did not want to
starve.</p>

<p>Of course that started the baby
off, and for a few moments no one
could hear themselves think, much
less talk.</p>

<p>Frisky having been sent out of
the room, and the baby being pacified
with an acorn-cup to play with,
Mr. <span class="cor" title="Source: Bushy-Tail" id="cor15">Bushy Tail</span> spoke:</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing to <span class="cor" title="Source: do; said he, go" id="cor15b">do;”
said he, “go</span> across the frozen pond,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">(16)</span>
and through the woods, to either my
cousin <span class="cor" title="Source: Red-Squirrel’s" id="cor16">Red Squirrel’s</span> or else to the
Chipmunks’. They will gladly lend
me corn or oats enough to feed us
for another month, and by that time
let us hope that Spring will have
come.”</p>

<p>“You’ll freeze in the deep <span class="cor" title="Source: snow,
said his wife, or" id="cor16b">snow,”
said his wife, “or</span> else you will be
blown to the North Pole by the
fierce wind. Then I shall be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">(18)</span>
widow, and what will the children
do? Oh dear! Oh dear!” and she
began to cry.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_017">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_017.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_017_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>Mr. <span class="cor" title="Source: Bushy-Tail" id="cor18">Bushy Tail</span> comforted her as
best he could, saying that he knew
the path well, that the trees would
protect him from the fierce wind,
and that he was too nimble and
quick to sink and freeze in the deep
snow.</p>

<p>At last, he promised not to go
the next morning, unless the weather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">(19)</span>
was fine, so they all went to bed
in their soft mossy nests.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>Bright and early the next
morning, Mr. Bushy Tail was up,
had washed his little face and paws,
and brushed out his pretty soft fur,
of which he was justly a trifle vain.
The sun was shining, and although
the air was very cold, he decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">(24)</span>
it was best for him to start for his
cousin Red Squirrel’s.</p>

<p>His wife bundled him up in a
warm sweater and socks, which she
had made him for a Christmas present.
Over his shoulder he slung a
bag for the corn, and promising
surely to be back in two days time,
he trotted away, after having kissed
the entire family three times all
around.</p>

<p>The traveling was much better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">(26)</span>
than he had feared it would be;
and he was fortunate enough to
find a bush full of late rose-hips,
from which he made a good dinner.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_025">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_025.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_025_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>Just as it was growing dark, he
reached his cousin Red Squirrel’s
house tree, and knocked on the
door. Receiving no answer, he
went in, for the neighborhood was
a very honest one, and nobody
locked their front doors, or their
back ones either.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_026a">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_026a.jpg"><img class="w100" src="images/i_026a_small.jpg" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">(27)</span></p>

<p>Poor Mr. Bushy Tail went from
room to room, but to his sorrow he
found no one, not even a mouse.
There were some acorns and dried
apples stowed away in one corner,
so he made a passable supper, but
he was worried by the thought, that
the next day he must go on to the
<span class="cor" title="Source: Chipmunk’s" id="cor27">Chipmunks’</span> for the corn, and so
might be unable to reach home the
same night, as he had promised his
little wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">(28)</span></p>

<p>However, there was no use in
borrowing trouble, so he curled
himself up in a warm corner, covered
his back with his broad bushy
tail, and was soon fast asleep, and
dreaming that he had carried home
a whole barrel full of food.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>The next morning as soon as
it was light enough to start,
Mr. Bushy Tail set off through the
woods to the Chipmunks’ house.
He arrived long before dinner time,
and found to his amazement, that
his cousin Red Squirrel with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">(32)</span>
wife and children, were making
the Chipmunks’ a visit.</p>

<p>They were all delighted to see
Mr. Bushy Tail but very sorry to
hear that his winter provisions had
given out. However Mr. Chipmunk
had a very large supply, and
he at once filled his friend’s bag
full of corn, rolled oats and dried
peas. Willingly would he have given
him twice as much, had Mr. Bushy
Tail been able to carry it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">(33)</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_033">

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">(34)</span></p>

<p>The family urged him to stay to
dinner, but the sky looked grey and
threatening, and Bushy Tail had a
long journey before him, so he ate
a hasty luncheon, thanked Mr.
Chipmunk once more for his kindness,
and with his heavy bag over
his shoulder, he scurried off as fast
as he could go.</p>

<p>Very soon the snow began to
fall, first, in large single flakes, and
then faster and thicker. Scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">(35)</span>
could Mr. Bushy Tail see the way;
and after bumping into first a tree,
and then a big bush, he lost his
footing, scrambled about for a minute
in the deep snow, and then sank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">(36)</span>
<em>down</em>, <strong>DOWN</strong>, <span class="stronger">DOWN</span>, and landed
kerplunk!</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_035">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_035.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_035_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>For an instant he was half-stunned,
then he sat up and looked
about him.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, my bag is
safe,” thought he, as he spied it in a
corner, where it had rolled. “What
should I have done if I had lost
that? I could not possibly have
walked up that toboggan slide to
find it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">(37)</span></p>

<p>Then he saw that he was sitting
in a bed of soft ashes, and realized
that he had fallen down somebody’s
chimney.</p>

<p>“Lucky there wasn’t a fire,”
said he, to himself, “or there would
have been toasted squirrel for supper.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Bushy Tail scrambled
out of the fire-place, he
found himself in a strange little underground
room, from which low
passage ways branched out in every
direction.</p>

<p>He ran down one of the passage
ways, but finding no one, he came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">(42)</span>
back and tried another. At the end
of this one, in a cosy little room, he
came unexpectedly upon an old acquaintance,
Mrs. Mole, who was
taking a comfortable afternoon
nap.</p>

<p>She awoke with such a start of
surprise at seeing Mr. Bushy Tail,
that she nearly fell out of her rocking-chair.</p>

<p>“I did not hear you knock,”
said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">(43)</span></p>

<p>“I did not knock, I dropped,”
said he.</p>

<p>Then he told her of his accident,
and apologized most politely, for
falling so unceremoniously down
her chimney.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mole assured him that he
was a welcome visitor at any time,
and only regretted that her chimney
had tripped him up.</p>

<p>She was very sorry that her husband
and sons were away on business,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">(45)</span>
but urged him strongly to stay
to supper.</p>

<p>With many thanks Mr. Bushy
Tail was obliged to decline her polite
invitation, but he assured her
that, considering his hungry family,
he must hurry home with his bag of
food as soon as possible, and begged
her to kindly show him the nearest
way out of her maze-like house.</p>

<p>When, after following Mrs. Mole
through a number of long, winding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">(47)</span>
passages, Mr. Bushy Tail came at
last to the surface of the ground, it
was snowing hard, and the dreaded
North wind was blowing half a
gale.</p>

</figure>

<p>He found himself outside the
shelter of the woods, on a broad
plain, and he felt that his only
safety lay in getting back among the
trees.</p>

<p>He started off at full speed, and
had gone some distance, when suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">(48)</span>
the North wind struck him,
and lifted him completely off his
four little paws.</p>

<p>There was no use in struggling, so
he lay quite still, and was whirled
away, faster and faster. <em>Miles and
miles was he blown</em>, until finally he fell
asleep from sheer exhaustion and
fright.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was night,
and still the wild wind was carrying
him far, far away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">(49)</span></p>

<p>His precious bag was still on his
shoulder, for he had clung to it even
in his terror, but the string had become
untied, and most of the food
had been blown away.</p>

<p>He ate a little of the corn,
but he was too frightened to be
hungry, and very soon, numb and
dazed with the cold, he fell asleep
again.</p>

</div>

<p>All the next day and night,
the fierce North wind kept
on blowing a gale, but towards
morning of the third day, it seemed
to Mr. Bushy Tail that he was
going more slowly, and just as the
sun rose, he was suddenly dropped.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp30" id="i_054">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_054.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_054_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>What he rested on he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">(54)</span>
tell, but in a few minutes, as it grew
lighter, he looked about him, and
saw it was a very high wooden
post. Then he knew he was sitting
on top of
the South
Pole, where
the North
wind <em>has</em> to
stop blowing,
or else
it becomes a
South wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">(55)</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">(56)</span></p>

<p>It was beautifully warm, and
poor Bushy Tail stretched himself
most comfortably in the sunshine,
and thawed out his half-frozen little
paws.</p>

<p>He felt very much shaken-up
and alone in the world, and, with
tears in his eyes, he thought of
his little wife and hungry babies,
and wondered if he should ever
get home to them.</p>

<p>In the first place, he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">(57)</span>
see any possible way of getting
down from his lofty perch. The
sides of the Pole were very smooth
and slippery, and the Pole itself
was much too high for comfort
or safety, if you tried jumping off.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_057">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_057.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_057_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>


<p>While he was pondering ways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">(58)</span>
and means of descent, he heard a
high squeaky voice say:</p>

<p>“Try the middle course.”</p>

<p>Peering over the edge of the
Pole, Mr. Bushy Tail espied on the
ground, far below, a funny little
creature, such as he had never seen
before. It was covered with long
blue quills, and moved slowly, and
with much dignity.</p>

<p>“What is the middle course?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">(59)</span>
asked Mr. Bushy Tail, timidly.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_058a">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_058a.jpg"><img class="w100" src="images/i_058a_small.jpg" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>“Why the middle of the Pole,
you goose!” replied the squeaky
voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Bushy Tail thought this
mode of address not strictly polite,
especially to a stranger, but he said
nothing, and looked about him on
top of the Pole.</p>

<p>Sure enough, right in the middle
was a little winding staircase, down
which he scrambled into darkness.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>The little staircase seemed very
dark and pokey to Mr. Bushy
Tail, and he devoutly hoped that
nothing would jump out and bite
him.</p>

<p>After a number of windings,
however, he saw a faint light below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">(65)</span>
him, and a few moments later, he
stepped through a low doorway,
and found himself close beside his
quilly acquaintance.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_064">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_064.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_064_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>“How do you do, and where
did you drop from?” asked Squeaky
Voice.</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know
where I dropped from,” replied
Mr. Bushy Tail, “but I came a
long distance, at a very high rate
of speed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">(66)</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">(67)</span></p>

<p>“Have a few ants for luncheon?”
inquired Mr. Quills.</p>

<p>“Have a few what?” asked the
astonished Mr. Bushy Tail.</p>

<p>“Ants,” replied the Quilly One.
“Red ants! White ants! Black ants!
Speckled ants!—just any kind of
ants. They are all excellent, both
as food and appetizers.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Mr.
Bushy Tail, in rather a disgusted
voice. “I do not care for ants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">(68)</span>
Do you eat nothing else?”</p>

<p>“Nothing!” answered the other
proudly. “I am the world famous
Quilly Ant-Eater, of whom you
have doubtless heard.”</p>

<p>Now Mr. Bushy Tail had never
heard of this celebrated personage,
but he was too wise to say so. He
only inquired where he could find
a few nuts, for he was half starved,
and also the nearest way to the
North.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">(69)</span></p>

<p>The squeaky Mr. Quilly Ant-Eater
led him to a charming wood,
where nuts grew in abundance, (as
well as ants) for here at the South
Pole it was
summer, and
the flowers
and trees
were in full
bloom.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp30" id="i_069">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_069.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_069_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>Mr. Bushy
Tail’s winter coat felt much too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">(70)</span>
warm, and as he could not shed it
until Spring came in the North, he
concluded that he had better travel
home as speedily as possible, or he
might melt away entirely.</p>

<p>Mr. Quills did not know the
way North, but he directed Mr.
Bushy Tail to an intimate friend of
his, Mr. Ring-Tailed Snorter, who
was a great traveller, and would
undoubtedly be able to help him.</p>

<p>Mr. Bushy Tail felt rather timid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">(71)</span>
about meeting a person with such
a fearsome name, but he felt that
he <em>must</em> hurry home to his perchance
starving family.</p>

<p>So, after thanking Mr. Quilly
Ant-Eater for his kindness, he took
his courage in his paws, and started
off to find Mr. Snorter.</p>

The Snortling of the Ring-Tailed Snorter"></a>
</figure>
</div>

<p>After travelling for several
miles, Mr. Bushy Tail entered
a lovely glade full of flowers and
ferns.</p>

<p>He had heard, as he approached,
a most peculiar noise, such as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">(76)</span>
had never heard in his life. As he
drew nearer, the sounds grew much
louder, and finally he saw the strangest
looking object seated on a tree
trunk.</p>

<p>It had the body and legs of a
kangaroo, and the head of a monkey.
Its tail was extremely long,
with furry rings around it, and was
tasseled at the end; and to keep it
out of the dust, it had been tied in a
bow-knot around the animal’s neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">(77)</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_077">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_077.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_077_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">(78)</span></p>

<p>The noise, which Mr. Bushy
Tail had heard, proceeded from this
person.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he inquired,
as Mr. Bushy Tail approached. “<em>I</em>
am the celebrated Ring-Tailed
Snorter, and you may now have the
privilege of hearing me snortle,”
which he proceeded to do most
vigorously.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Bushy Tail was scared
almost out of his wits, for never had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">(79)</span>
he heard such terrible sounds.</p>

<p>After a few minutes the Snorter
stopped snortling, and said:</p>

<p>“Now, <em>what</em> do you think of
that?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_079">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_079.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_079_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>“<em>Never</em> have I heard anything to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">(80)</span>
equal it,” replied the tactful Mr.
Bushy Tail, and he certainly never
had.</p>

<p>“If you’ll stay with me, I’ll do
it for you every day,” said Mr. Ring
Tail.</p>

<p>“Thank you kindly,” said Mr.
Bushy Tail, “but much as I should
enjoy it, I must go home as soon as
I can to my starving <span class="cor" title="Source: family." id="cor80">family.”</span></p>

<p>He then told Mr. Snorter what
had befallen him, and of his great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">(82)</span>
desire to travel back to the North,
in the speediest manner.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="i_081">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_081.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_081_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>“Come on!” said Mr. Ring
Tail. “Just jump on my back, and
I will take you to a friend of mine,
who can whisk you there in no
time.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t I better fill my bag
first with these fine nuts?” asked
Mr. Bushy Tail.</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t bother about
that; you’ll find nuts all the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">(83)</span>
home,” answered the other. So on
jumped Mr. Bushy Tail, and away
they went.</p>

<p>“Hang on tight to my tail,”
said the Snorter, as he leaped along.</p>

<p>Never had Mr. Bushy Tail travelled
at such a peculiar gait. It was
like leap frog, only more so, and
he felt as though he were on a ship
at sea. However, he held on tight,
and hoped for the best.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>Towards evening, they reached
the top of a high hill, where
Mr. Ring-Tailed Snorter stopped
leaping, and gazed towards the
South.</p>

<p>“Here comes my friend,” said
he. “Good bye,” and without
a “by your leave,” or the chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">(89)</span>
of a “Thank you again,” the South
wind had caught up Mr. Bushy
Tail and was whirling him rapidly
Northwards.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp30" id="i_088">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_088.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_088_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>For nearly a week they travelled
on, but much more pleasantly than
with the fierce North wind.</p>

<p>At times the wind would stop
blowing, and Mr. Bushy Tail would
be gently dropped in some pretty
wood or meadow, where he could
find plenty to eat and to drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">(90)</span></p>

<p>He filled his bag to overflowing
with the most delicious squirrel’s
food, and only regretted that the
bag was not bigger.</p>

<p>At last one evening, the wind
softly dropped him, and blew on
alone. Mr. Bushy Tail looked about
him, and saw that he was in his own
woods, only a short distance from
home.</p>

<p>How fast he scampered toward
his house tree. He scarcely noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">(92)</span>
that since he had gone away Spring
had come, and the first soft green
shoots were covering the trees. The
grass was full of flowers, and the
birds were singing merrily.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_091">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_091.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_091_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>Quickly he ran up into his nest,
and there they all were, the dear
wee family; Mrs. Bushy Tail, the
children, and dear old Grandmother
Chipmunk.</p>

<p>How delighted they were to see
him. Poor little Mrs. Bushy Tail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">(93)</span>
quite broke down and cried with
joy, for she had never expected to
see her husband alive again.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_092a">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_092a.jpg"><img class="w100" src="images/i_092a_small.jpg" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>Mr. Chipmunk and Mr. Red
Squirrel had come over, a few days
after Mr. Bushy Tail’s visit, to inquire
if he had reached home safely,
and to bring great bags of provisions.
When they heard that their friend
was still missing, they had looked
very anxious and sad.</p>

<p>The snow storm, in which Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">(95)</span>
Bushy Tail was blown away, had
turned into such an awful blizzard,
that every one thought he had been
buried in the deep snow and frozen.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="i_094">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_094.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_094_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>What a fine supper Mrs. Bushy
Tail cooked from the wonderful
bag, and how much they all ate.</p>

<p>Mr. Bushy Tail was told what a
good boy Frisky had been, and how
the baby had cut a new tooth, with
which he had accidentally bitten
Grandma Chipmunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">(96)</span></p>

</figure>

<p>Then, after
the baby had been
tucked away in his soft nest, they all
sat down close to the fire, while Mr.
Bushy Tail, taking Frisky on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">(97)</span>
knee, told them of all his wonderful
adventures. Of Mr. Quilly Ant-Eater
and the Ring-Tailed Snorter;
of that surprising slide down Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">(98)</span>
Mole’s chimney, and of the terrible
North wind.</p>
